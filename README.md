# Doubly Linked List in C

This project implements a doubly linked list in C. It includes functions to create, append, prepend, delete, print, and free the list.

## Files

- `linklist.h`: Header file containing the declarations of the data structures and functions.
- `linklist.c`: Source file containing the implementations of the functions.
- `main.c`: Source file containing the `main` function to demonstrate the usage of the linked list functions.

## Usage

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc -o run-linklist main.c linklist.c
```
```sh
./run-linklist
```
